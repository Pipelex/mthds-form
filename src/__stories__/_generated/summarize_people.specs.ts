/**
 * Specs captured for the heroes of data/methods/summarize_people/bundle.mthds - DO NOT EDIT.
 *
 * Regenerate the designer method's entries with `make fixtures-specs`, which runs
 * `data/generative/ui-designer.mthds` on the hosted API through `@pipelex/sdk` over
 * each hero's brief (MODEL=, SEED= and TEMPERATURE= choose the run) and validates
 * what came back against the catalog. Take in another producer's JSONL with the
 * `--capture` command of scripts/generate-fixtures.mjs, which validates it the same
 * way. Both cost inference budget, which is why neither is implied by `make fixtures`.
 *
 * **A spec is a payload's twin: the one artifact no projection can produce.** Each
 * entry records WHO produced it (the method on the hosted API, a coding agent in a
 * fresh context, or the session working in this repo, by hand), on which model, with
 * which seed and critic loop when there was one, and the hash of the prompt it was
 * produced against - the designer method and the catalog data, together; the corpus
 * test compares that hash with the current one, so a prompt change that invalidates a
 * spec is a failing test rather than a stale page.
